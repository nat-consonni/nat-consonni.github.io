// project loading logic


//The idea behind having a separate projects.js file is to centralize all your project data in one place and potentially handle logic like:

//Loading project previews dynamically

//Rendering your latest projects section in the Home page

//Creating cards or links for the case studies

//Handling filters or sorting (e.g. by tag, type, year)

//Making it easier to scale without manually updating HTML every time
