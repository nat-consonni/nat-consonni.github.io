// project loading logic


//The idea behind having a separate projects.js file is to centralize all my project data in one place and potentially handle logic like:
//Loading project previews dynamically
//Rendering my latest projects section in the Home page
//Creating cards or links for the case studies
//Handling filters or sorting (e.g. by tag, type, year)
//Making it easier to scale without manually updating HTML every time
